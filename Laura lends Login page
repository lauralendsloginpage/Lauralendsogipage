Everything in this world has a good side and a bad side. Oftentimes, these things determine whether one idea or undertaking is worth the risk or not. This is also true with payday loans. The term 'payday loan' is derived from the word payday wherein you will repay the loan on the said time.

What is a payday loan? For those of you who don't know what the loan is al about, this is an excellent chance to discover its good and the bad side. Basically, a payday loan is a short-term loan given to borrowers between payday periods to help finance urgent expenses or difficulties. The loans are sometimes called cash advances or paycheck advances and is often limited to $1500 only.

Payday loans have definitely received considerable controversy. This is where the 'cons' enter as critics claim that lenders target the helpless poor and the innocent young adults. These people, as the critics say, don't understand the importance of money. They even call lenders as loan sharks because of the high interest charges which can reach as high as 250% depending on the credit score of the borrower and the loan amount.
